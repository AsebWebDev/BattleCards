# BattleCards ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project-%231-brightgreen.svg)
## 1st Ironhack Project - a browser card game, based on quartet. After two weeks of learning at the ironhack bootcamp I created this game in week three with Javascript & jQuery and CSS & Semantic-UI.

**Introduction**

![](https://github.com/AsebWebDev/BattleCards/blob/master/img/screenshot.png)


Its a two player game with a shared screen and one mouse. 

1. the players roll the dice to determine who may start the game. 

2. each player has a deck of cards (in this case 3). Each round the players place a card 
 of their deck into the middle (battlefield).

3. The current player chooses a character trait of the character on the corresponding card. With this value the players compete against each other. Each player rolls the dice and the value rolled is added to the value of the character trait. The highest total wins the round. 

**Setup**

If youâ€™d like to view my project in your browser, go to my github-page:

or you can clone the project like this:

**Coding process**

The greatest challenge was to create a 2-player game on one screen using only click-events. "Bubbling" was one of the problems i needed to get familiar with. After learning about that, i could solve a major bug that occured during the coding. Another challenge is to structure the different game phases in the code, so users are lead through the game fluently. Giving the user feedback on what is happening was important. A fun part was designing the characters and make the website responsive and pretty. A future implementation would be an online functionality, so the players do not need share a screen.
